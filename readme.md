## Local Setup Instructions

To run this project locally on your machine, you will need to set up your own MySQL database. I have provided the MySQL DDL script in the `src/main/resources/ddl` folder, in a file named `ddl.sql`. 

After setting up the database, please ensure to configure the `application.properties` file to connect the application to your database.
